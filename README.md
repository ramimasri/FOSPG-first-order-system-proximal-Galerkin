# FOSPG: First Order System Proximal Galerkin

This repository contains the code to reproduce the numerical examples in our paper:

**Guosheng Fu, Brendan Keith, Rami Masri. A locally-conservative proximal Galerkin method for pointwise bound constraints.**

This implementation is [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org/). We refer to [NGSolve installation commands](https://ngsolve.org/downloads) to get started.
